1. According to the forum, the following line is legal, since all the leadinig white spaces have to be ignored:
     label1:   sub r1,r7
Thus in my solution this line is legal and the label is not ignored (unlike in badpath-pass1, case 18).


2. In my solution, in label declaration, the dots must be followed by white space (one at least):
i.e. this legal:
LABEL: mov r1,r2

this is illegal:
LABEL:mov r1,r2
